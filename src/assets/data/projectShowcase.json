A README file is a document that provides essential information about a project, such as its name, description, installation, usage, license, and contributors. README Generator simplifies the process of creating a README file by asking the user to input the relevant details and then formatting them into a markdown file. The motivation behind creating DocuGen-JS was to streamline the often tedious process of crafting README files for software projects, github repos, etc. As a developer myself, I've experienced firsthand the hassle of repeatedly writing and formatting READMEs for various projects. With DocuGen-JS, my aim is to alleviate this burden by providing a simple and efficient tool that automates the generation of README files. By abstracting away the manual labor involved in creating these essential project documents, developers can focus more on coding and less on documentation, ultimately enhancing productivity and project clarity. To use DocuGen-JS, you need to have node js installed on your system. You can download node js from here. Once you have node js, you can clone this repository or download the zip file. Then, navigate to the folder where you have the app and run node index.js in your terminal. You will be prompted to answer some questions about your project, such as its name, description, installation, usage, license, and contributors. After you answer all the questions, a README.md file will be generated in the same folder. You can then edit, rename, or move the file as you wish."
