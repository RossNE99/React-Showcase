# React-Showcase
## Ross Charlton - React - Web development portfolio 🚀

## Description

This repository showcases my web development portfolio using React & Bootstrap, as a testament to my skills in the dynamic field of web development. Crafted with a mission to highlight my expertise, it serves as a vital asset in today's competitive market.

The main aim of this GitHub project is to use React to improve on [previous portfolio](https://rossne99.github.io/Bootstrap-portfolio/). The motivation behind this project was to recreate my portfolio and retain the functionality and with thanks to the use of React the code in this project is a lot diffrent to the previous portfolio as here i have used NodeJS and react. React uses the JSX syntax whitch is alot diffrent from normal html. 

The problem with Traditional HTML and CSS, while foundational for web development, often lead to repetitive and verbose code. Developers must manually handle browser compatibility and responsiveness, which can result in a cluttered codebase. This approach lacks modularity, making maintenance and scaling difficult. By integrating Node.js and React, developers can streamline their workflow. Node.js offers a vast ecosystem of packages, allowing for reusable components and efficient build processes. React’s component-based architecture enables a more organized and maintainable code structure. Together, they facilitate faster development, better performance, and a more dynamic user experience. React’s virtual DOM and Node.js’s non-blocking I/O model further optimize rendering and server communication, respectively. This modern stack transforms the development process, making it more agile and robust.
